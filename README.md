# Train Car Tracker

I started riding MARTA for fun (don't ask!) and wanted to track what cars I've
ridden. I've got a spreadsheet, but that's pretty cumbersome when I'm trying
to get on and off the train. I'm going to try and fire off a Python app that I
can use to easily document the car, date, and line.
